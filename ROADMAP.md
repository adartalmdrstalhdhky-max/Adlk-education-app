🔹 Current Technical Status (Important)
Flutter project structure exists
Android build fails due to Gradle / SDK configuration
No production APK generated yet
Core logic modules are not implemented yet
Project is currently blocked at Android build stage
🔹 Development Principles
Offline-first architecture (mandatory)
Clean & modular codebase
No hard dependency on cloud services
AI modules must remain optional and isolated
Curriculum must be data-driven (JSON / Excel), not hardcoded
🔹 Notes for Contributors
This repository represents a real early-stage system, not a demo.
The immediate priority is fixing Android build configuration.
Once build is stable, feature implementation will proceed stage by stage.
Contributors can clearly see what is done vs what is planned.
🟢 Status
This roadmap reflects the current real state of the project
and will be updated after each completed stage.
