## 🔹 Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Structure:** Always use `STRUCTURE.md` as reference.  
2. **Feature Branches:** Each stage should have its own branch.  
3. **Offline-First:** All features must work offline first.  
4. **Modular Code:** Ensure each feature can be updated independently.  
5. **AI Module:** Must remain self-contained and no direct mention of ChatGPT.

## 🔹 Notes

- The roadmap is dynamic and will be updated as the project evolves.  
- After MVP completion, official collaborators and funding stages will be added.  
- Developers joining later will use this roadmap to know exactly what to implement next.
